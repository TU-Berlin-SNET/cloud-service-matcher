		<dl>
			<dt>axis</dt>
			<dd></dd>
			<dt>BookPriceFinder</dt>
			<dd>The <a href="BookPriceFinder/readme.html">Book Price Finder</a> example.
			A simple example which demonstrates how to use Dino Broker.</dd>
			<dt>BookPriceFinderRemote</dt>
			<dd>The <a href="BookPriceFinderRemote/readme.html">Book Price Finder: Remote</a> example.
			An example which accesses a remote Dino Broker deployed as a web service.</dd>
			<dt>doc</dt>
			<dd>Contains the JavaDoc documentation for the Dino Broker.</dd>
			<dt>lib</dt>
			<dd>Contains dino.jar and the support libaries which it uses.</dd>
			<dt>ontology-cache</dt>
			<dd>Stores commonly accessed ontologies so that they can be accessed even if the URL
			of the ontology cannot be reached. Additional cached ontologies can be added here manually. An entry
			must also be manually added to the file service.idx in this folder which is an index of ontology files and
			their associated URIs.</dd>
			<dt>owls-services</dt>
			<dd>OWL-S service descriptions which the Dino Broker will search to find a service match.
			Additional service descriptions can be added here and the Dino Broekr will search them.. </dd>
			<dt>RestaurantSearch</dt>
			<dd>The <a href="RestaurantSearch/readme.html">Restaurant Search</a> example. A more complex example.
			Uses a Dino Broker to search for restaurants and display maps of their location using
			a number of services.</dd>
		</dl>

		<p>When the Dino Broker is run for the first time an additional directory called "repository" will be created.
		This directory contains extracted service information from the services in the "owls-service" directory. If you get unexpected
		match results, especially after modifying a service description, then try deleting this file so that Dino Broker rebuilds it.</p>


		<h2>Requirements</h2>
		<p>Dino Broker requires the <a href="http://www.java.com">Java Runtime Environment</a> version 5 or greater.</p>

		<h2 id="axisDeploy">Deploying Dino Broker to Axis</h2>
		<p>Dino Broker can be deployed as a web service is Axis. This makes the same broekr accesible to many clients.</p>
		<p>To deploy Dino Broker to Axis, perform the following steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>If you don't have an application server installed then you need to install one.
			This is necessary as Axis runs inside an application server. A good choice is
			<a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache Tomcat</a>.</li>
			<li>If you don't already have an Axis installation, install
			<a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/">Axis</a>, using these
			<a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/java/install.html">instructions</a>.</li>
			<li>You should now have an "axis" directory inside your application server installation. Inside you should
			have an "WEB-INF" directory which contains a "lib" directory.
			You must copy all the JAR files in the sub-directories of your Dino "lib" directory to this "lib" directory.
			All the JAR files must be copied to the top levelof the "lib" directory in the Axis installation (that is, they
			should not be in sub-directories).</li>
			<li>Copy the directories "owls-services" and "ontology-cache" from your dino installation directory to your application
			server. In Tomcat, copy these directories to the top level directory
			of your Tomcat installation.
			In other application servers, the location may vary. These directories are reached using the paths
			"../owls-services" and "../ontology-cache" so copy these directories to the appropiate location in your
			application server installation. </li>
			<li>If your application server is already running, it may be necessary to restart it or to restart the Axis application
			within your application server.</li>
			<li>If necessary, modify the "host" and "port" properties in "build.xml" in the "axis" directory of your installation to
			the host and port of your application server. By default these have the valuea "localhost" and "8080" so if you
			have a default Tomcat installation on the same machine where you installed the Dino distribution then you will not need
			to change these.</li>
			<li>To deploy the Dino Broker web service, first make sure the application server is running.
			Change to the "axis" directory of you Dino installation
			and run the command "ant". You will need to have <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> installed. Otherwise, see the
			<a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/java/install.html#Step6DeployingYourWebService">Axis documentation on
				how to use the AdminClient directly</a>.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Undeployment</h3>
		<p>To undeploy, run the command "ant undeploy" in the "axis" directory of the Dino installation or see the
		<a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/java/install.html#Step6DeployingYourWebService">Axis documentation on the AdminClient.</a>.
