		<h1>Book Price Finder: Remote</h1>
		<p>This is a test application which uses a remote Dino Broker which is deployed as a web service.
		This example is the same as the <a href="../BookPriceFinder/readme.html">Book Price Finder example</a>
		but it uses a remote broker rather than a lcoal broker.
		The source code is found in the "src" folder.</p>
		
		<h2>To Run</h2>
		<p>you will first have to have deployed Dino Broker as an Axis web application
		(<a href="../readme.html#axisDeploy">instructions</a>). You will then need to modify the file "remoteBookFinder.properties"
		in the "RemoteBookPriceFinder" folder and set the values of the properties "broker-host", "broker-port" and "broker-file" to
		the lcoation of the Dino Broker web service. The default URL is "http://localhost:8080/axis/services/DinoBrokerService" so if
		the broker is deployed locally to Apache Tomcat on port 8080 then you will not need to cahnge anything.
		Once this is done, you can run the example using one of the methods below.</p>

		<h3>Easy way</h3>
		<p>Run remoteBookFinder.jar in the RemoteBookPriceFinder folder, for example by clicking or double clicking on it.
		This should work in many cases. If it doesn't then use one of the methods below.</p>

		<h3>Java command line</h3>
		<p>At the console / command prompt, navigate to the RemoteBookPriceFinder directory and then execute "java -jar remoteBookFinder.jar".</p>

		<h3>Windows</h3>
		<p>Execute "run.bat" in the RemoteBookPriceFinder folder.</p>

		<h3>Ant</h3>
		<p>At the console / command prompt, navigate to the RemoteBookPriceFinder directory and then execute "ant run".</p>

		<h2>To Recompile</h2>
		<p>You will need the latest version of <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a>.</p>
		<p>Execute "ant" to compile and create remoteBookFinder.jar. Execute "ant run" to run.</p>

		<h2>Short Overview of the Code</h2>
		<p>The classes are the same as the <a href="../BookPriceFinder/readme.html">Book Price Finder example</a> except
		that the class BookPriceFinder communicates with a remote Dino Broker rather than creating a local Dino Broker instance.</p>
