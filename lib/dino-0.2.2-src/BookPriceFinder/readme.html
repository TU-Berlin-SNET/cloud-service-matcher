		<h1>Book Price Finder</h1>
		<p>This is a test application which uses a local Dino Broker to invoke services. It will confirm that
		Dino is working and demonstrates how to use the Dino Broker. The source code is found in the "src" folder.
		This example is quite limited in that it makes use of only a single service. It does however use a real service
		provided by an external entity.</p>
		
		<h2>To Run</h2>
		<h3>Easy way</h3>
		<p>Run bookFinder.jar in the BookPriceFinder folder, for example by clicking or double clicking on it.
		This should work in many cases. If it doesn't then use one of the methods below.</p>

		<h3>Java command line</h3>
		<p>At the console / command prompt, navigate to the BookPriceFinder directory and then execute "java -jar bookFinder.jar".</p>

		<h3>Windows</h3>
		<p>Execute "run.bat" in the BookPriceFinder folder.</p>

		<h3>Ant</h3>
		<p>At the console / command prompt, navigate to the BookPriceFinder directory and then execute "ant run".</p>

		<h2>To Recompile</h2>
		<p>You will need the latest version of <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a>.</p>
		<p>Execute "ant" to compile and create bookFinder.jar. Execute "ant run" to run.</p>

		<h2>Short Overview of the Code</h2>
		<p>There are four classes. The most important is the BookPriceFinder class as this contains the
		Dino Broker code. The "initBroker" method sets up the Dino Broker and registers the ReqDoc
		<a href="reqdoc.xml">reqdoc.xml</a>. The other important method is "findBookPrice(String bookISBN)"
		which invokes the price finder service when the user clicks on the "search" button.</p>
